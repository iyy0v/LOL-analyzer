# LOLYZER

A serverless web app where users can access and analyze [League of Legends](https://www.leagueoflegends.com/) accounts stats and history.

It's **LIVE** ! you can visit and try the app [here](https://lolyzer.ayoub-dev.com/).

## Features
- **Account search** on all available regions and servers.
- **General information** displayed about the account : name, region, icon, level, rank (Solo/Duo and Flex).
- **Automated MMR check** on [WhatIsMyMMR](https://whatismymmr.com).
- **Main champions** played on the account displayed in order including their Mastery, Mastery Points and Last time played.
- **Statistics** visualized in different charts including Win/Loss ratio on main game modes as well as played lanes from the last 20 recent games played.
- **History** of the last 20 recent games played with some very specific details including the Game Mode, Date, Duration, Result, Champion , Items , Runes, Score, Achievements, Players and more.
- **Multiple accounts** can be added to the account list for quick access.

I could have added more useful features but they would've taken a substantial amount of time so I decided not to do so since I am not planning to commercialize this app and I wanted to work on other projects.
